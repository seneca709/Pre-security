Introduction to Offensive security <br>
<i>What is Offensive security? </i><br>
Offensive security is the process of breaking into computer systems, exploiting software bugs, and finding loopholes in applications to gain unauthorized access to them.<br>
<i>What is deffensive security</i><br>
ould be investigating infected computers or devices to understand how it was hacked, tracking down cybercriminals, or monitoring infrastructure for malicious activity.<br>
<h5>Hack your first machine</h5>
<b>Scenario:
Use a command-line application called "GoBuster"
to brute-force FakeBank's website to find hidden directories and pages.
GoBuster will take a list of potential page or
directory names and tries accessing a website with each of them;
if the page exists, it tells you.

<br>
<i>Step 1) Open a terminal </i> <br>
<i>Step 2) Find hidden website pages</i> <br>
Context:Most companies will have an admin portal page,
giving their staff access to basic admin controls
for day-to-day operations.
For a bank, an employee might need to transfer money
to and from client accounts. Often these pages are
not made private, allowing attackers to find hidden
pages that show, or give access to, admin controls or sensitive data.
<br>
<i> Step 3) You found a secret bank transfer page that allows you to transfer money between accounts at the bank (/bank-transfer).
Type the hidden page into the FakeBank website on the machine.
</i> <br>
<i>Questions</i>
This page allows an attacker to steal money
from any bank account, which is a critical risk for the bank.
As an ethical hacker, you would (with permission) find vulnerabilities
in their application and
report them to the bank to fix before a hacker exploits them. <br>

<b>Transfer $2000 from the bank account 2276, to your account (account number 8881). </b> <br>
<b>Above your account balance, you should now see a message indicating the answer to this question. Can you find the answer you need?</b>
